# ABM-of-Inter-Species-Interactions-in-Agroforestry
Our ABM model is a comprehensive simulation of an integrated multispecies agroforestry system for yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) cultivation in conjunction with nine consociated tree species. This model aims to capture the complex web of direct and indirect interactions within the system.
